# Global COVID-19 Death and Infection Analysis Utilizing SQL for Querying and Tableau for Visualization

## Project Objectives
I conducted an analysis of global COVID-19 infection and death rates to raise awareness about the ongoing impact of the virus in specific regions. This analysis aims to inform and encourage people to continue taking precautions, helping to reduce the spread and protect vulnerable communities.

## Data Used
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Questions KPIs
Analyze the global COVID-19 case and mortality rates as of October 2024.
Calculate the infection fatality rate (probability of death upon infection).
Identify continents with the highest mortality rates.
Determine the percentage of the population infected per country.
Compute the global average infection rate across populations.

## Process
Validated the dataset to identify and address any missing values or anomalies, ensuring data accuracy.
Ensured data integrity by verifying consistency in data types, formats, and values.
Began the querying process to analyze the following metrics:
•	Total COVID-19 cases relative to the population.
•	Global case count, death toll, and average mortality rate.
•	Percentage of the global population infected with COVID-19.
•	Countries with the highest infection rates relative to population.
•	Countries with the highest death counts relative to population.
