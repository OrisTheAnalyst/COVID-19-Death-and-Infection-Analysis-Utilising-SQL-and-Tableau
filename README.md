# Global COVID-19 Death and Infection Analysis Utilizing SQL for Querying and Tableau for Visualization

## Project Objectives
I conducted an analysis of global COVID-19 infection and death rates to raise awareness about the ongoing impact of the virus in specific regions. This analysis aims to inform and encourage people to continue taking precautions, helping to reduce the spread and protect vulnerable communities.

## Data Used
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Questions KPIs
Analyze the global COVID-19 case and mortality rates as of October 2024.
Calculate the infection fatality rate (probability of death upon infection).
Identify continents with the highest mortality rates.
Determine the percentage of the population infected per country.
Compute the global average infection rate across populations.

## Process
Validated the dataset to identify and address any missing values or anomalies, ensuring data accuracy.
Ensured data integrity by verifying consistency in data types, formats, and values.
Began the querying process to analyze the following metrics:
•	Total COVID-19 cases relative to the population.
•	Global case count, death toll, and average mortality rate.
•	Percentage of the global population infected with COVID-19.
•	Countries with the highest infection rates relative to population.
•	Countries with the highest death counts relative to population.

## Project Insight
•	North America has experienced the highest number of COVID-19 deaths, with over 1.19 million people lost, followed closely by South America. In contrast, Oceania has seen the lowest death toll, with just over 25,000 deaths.
•	The percentage of the population infected varies across countries, with the United States at 30.58%, the United Kingdom at 36.97%, China at 6.9%, and India at 3.18%.
•	Based on current trends in human activity and lifestyle, the forecast indicates that infections will continue to rise globally.
•	On average, around 1.1% of the world’s population has been infected with COVID-19.


## Conclusion and Recommendation:

This analysis offers a clear view of COVID-19's impact worldwide, with North America showing the highest death toll at over 1.19 million, while Oceania experienced the least, with just over 25,000 deaths. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and India showed varying infection rates, ranging from 30.58% to 3.18%. The global infection rate remains at an average of around 1.1%. Based on current trends in human activity and lifestyle, infection rates are likely to continue rising.

To mitigate this, it’s essential to closely monitor countries with higher infection and death rates, particularly in regions showing an upward trend. Governments and health organizations should focus on targeted interventions, promoting public health initiatives and encouraging sustained preventive measures to curb the spread. By acting proactively, we can help reduce the global impact of future waves of the pandemic.
